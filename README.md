## Background

* In this project I created a Python script for analyzing a company's financial records. The financial dataset is a csv file composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`.

## Step by Step

* The Python script analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
